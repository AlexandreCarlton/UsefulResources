# Useful Resources

Every so often I find a link on Hacker News or Reddit which I bookmark and
promise myself to get around to finishing later. Of course, generally I never
do so and results in an dishevelled heap that is hard to locate.

So for now this is a small list of things onto which I'll just tack links that
I might need later.
